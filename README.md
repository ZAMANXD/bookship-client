Project documentation for BookShip website using React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript

# Introduction:
This project aims to create a bookselling website where users can browse and purchase books online. The website will be built using React for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, MongoDB for the database, and TypeScript for type checking.

Front-end:
React will be used to create the user interface for the website. The components will be organized in a logical and modular structure to make it easy to maintain and scale the application in the future. The website will also be responsive to ensure optimal user experience on different devices.

Back-end:
Node.js and Express.js will be used to create the server-side logic for the website. Express.js will handle the routing and handle requests from the client-side while Node.js will provide the runtime environment to execute the JavaScript code.

Database:
MongoDB will be used to store the data for the website. MongoDB is a non-relational database that is well suited for storing unstructured data such as book details and user information.

TypeScript:
TypeScript will be used for type checking throughout the application. This will help to catch errors early in the development process and make the code more maintainable.

Functionality:
The website will have the following functionality:

    User authentication and registration
    Browse books by category, author, and publisher
    Search for books by keyword
    View book details
    Add books to a shopping cart
    Purchase books using a secure payment gateway
    View order history and track orders


Documentation:
Clear and detailed documentation will be provided for the application, including instructions for setting up the development environment, instructions for deploying the application, and an API reference for the back-end.

Conclusion:
This bookselling website will provide an easy and convenient way for users to browse and purchase books online. The use of React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript will make the application scalable, maintainable, and easy to develop.
