        "description": "This book, with a focus on English and Polish, is a study of surveying terminology, which may be considered as an under-researched area when compared to legal, medical or business terminologies. It examines differences between terms and concepts in the two languages. The purpose of the book is three-fold: firstly, to investigate how surveying terms are created and how they are named in English and Polish; secondly, to analyse concept systems of the two languages with respect to surveying terminology; and thirdly, to indicate the areas of surveying in which terminological and conceptual differences occur, the factors that trigger them and translation strategies which are used to solve them. The book offers a systematic, corpus-based approach to terminology. Data for analyses come from the English and Polish surveying corpora compiled specifically for this project. The author of the book attempts to provide a wide picture of surveying terminology by looking at problems that diversified groups of users may identify. The book is directed towards terminologists and lexicographers, for whom it provides a set of guidelines on how to enrich the content of surveying dictionaries, translators and technical writers, who may find information on how to deal with conceptual mismatches, and to specialists in the surveying field, who are interested in finding equivalents for problematic terms."

        "description": "The specialized jargon of some sports can be quite esoteric. Non-Americans, for example, are likely puzzled by baseball terms such as bunt, cut-off man, and safety squeeze, while the non-British may pause over cricket's Chinaman, doosra, golden duck, off-break, popping crease, and yorker. This new dictionary gives the definitions of more than 8,000 terms used in sports and games from around the world, including mainstream sports like basketball and billiards alongside the more obscure netball and snooker. Entries cover sports equipment, strategies, venues, qualifying categories, awards, and administrative bodies, while a comprehensive system of cross-references offers assistance and clarification when needed. An appendix lists standard abbreviations of sports ruling bodies and administrative organizations."
